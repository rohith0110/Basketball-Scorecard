## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project was built to practice core web development skills using:

- **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the application.
- **CSS3:** For styling, layout, animations, and responsive design. Custom properties (variables) were used for easy theme management.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** For all the interactive logic, including DOM manipulation, event handling (clicks and key presses), and managing the timer with `setInterval`.
